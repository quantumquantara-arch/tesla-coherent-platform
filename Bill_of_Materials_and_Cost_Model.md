# Bill of Materials (BOM) & Cost Model  
Tesla × Quantara — Engineering Document

---

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the bill of materials (BOM), component-class definitions, and cost-model structure for manufacturing systems that integrate Quantara’s stabilized-energy architecture.  
It provides a clear, scalable financial overview aligned with Tesla’s procurement, manufacturing, and cost-optimization processes.

## 2. BOM Structure Overview

The BOM is organized into five component classes:

1. **Class A — Critical Components**  
   - core energy-path structures  
   - high-load materials  
   - thermal interfaces  
   - power distribution elements  

2. **Class B — Structural Components**  
   - frames  
   - brackets  
   - mechanical mounts  

3. **Class C — Electronic Components**  
   - sensors  
   - processors  
   - wiring harnesses  
   - control modules  

4. **Class D — Thermal Components**  
   - heat spreaders  
   - cooling channels  
   - thermal pads and conductive layers  

5. **Class E — Assembly & Fasteners**  
   - bolts  
   - adhesives  
   - connectors  
   - alignment fixtures  

Each class contains traceable part numbers, quantities, and sourcing parameters.

## 3. Cost Model Overview

The cost model includes:

- material cost  
- machining/fabrication cost  
- assembly labor  
- testing and QA  
- overhead allocation  
- supply chain variability  
- scale-adjusted cost reduction  
- long-term optimization potential  

Cost ranges are represented volumetrically (per unit, per batch, or per subsystem).

## 4. Cost Breakdown by Component Class

### Class A — Critical Components  
Higher cost due to material precision, stabilized pathways, and performance requirement.  
- Material Cost: **High**  
- Fabrication: **Medium–High**  
- QA Requirements: **High**  

### Class B — Structural Components  
- Material Cost: **Medium**  
- Fabrication: **Medium–Low**  
- QA Requirements: **Medium**  

### Class C — Electronic Components  
- Material Cost: **Low–Medium**  
- Fabrication: **Low**  
- QA Requirements: **High**  

### Class D — Thermal Components  
- Material Cost: **Medium**  
- Fabrication: **Medium**  
- QA Requirements: **Medium**  

### Class E — Assembly & Fasteners  
- Material Cost: **Low**  
- Fabrication: **Low**  
- QA Requirements: **Low**

## 5. Supplier Classifications

Suppliers are grouped into:

- **Tier 1:** Core material & high-precision fabrication  
- **Tier 2:** Electronics and subsystem-level components  
- **Tier 3:** General assembly components and fasteners  

Each supplier classification includes audit and certification requirements.

---

## 6. Cost-Reduction Pathways

Optimizations include:

- economies of scale  
- material-forming refinements  
- simplified assembly sequences  
- reduced process variance  
- improved thermal and electrical efficiency (lower waste)  
- integration of multi-function components  

Quantara’s stabilization reduces drift, enabling smaller tolerance windows and fewer rejected parts.

---

## 7. Lifecycle Cost Considerations

Lifecycle cost model includes:

- operating cost (energy efficiency)  
- cooling-cycle cost reduction  
- extended subsystem lifespan  
- reduced maintenance frequency  
- lower replacement cost over time  

Stabilized-energy systems improve resilience and reduce long-term cost.

---

## 8. BOM Tracking & Documentation

Each part requires:

- part number  
- revision number  
- supplier ID  
- unit cost  
- batch/lot tracking  
- inspection records  
- compliance certification  

All BOM data must be synchronized with Tesla’s procurement systems.

---

## 9. Financial Risk Factors

Key risks include:

- raw material market fluctuation  
- supply chain bottlenecks  
- certification delays  
- fabrication capacity  
- unexpected testing failures  

All risks must be monitored through Tesla’s procurement dashboard.

---

## 10. Summary

This BOM and cost-model framework ensures that all Quantara-enabled systems can be manufactured efficiently, scalably, and with full financial transparency.  
It aligns with Tesla’s internal standards and creates a clear structure for cost optimization and supply-chain stability.
