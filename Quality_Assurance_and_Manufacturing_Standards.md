# Quality Assurance & Manufacturing Standards  
Tesla × Quantara — Engineering Document

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the quality-assurance (QA), manufacturing, inspection, and production requirements for integrating Quantara’s stabilized-energy components, materials, and subsystems into Tesla’s manufacturing environment.  
It ensures consistent, safe, and repeatable production across all stages of development.

---

## 2. Quality Objectives

Manufacturing must achieve:

- consistent part quality  
- predictable subsystem performance  
- stable structural, electrical, and thermal characteristics  
- minimized variance across production batches  
- full traceability for all components  
- compliance with Tesla’s factory and QA standards  

---

## 3. Manufacturing Requirements

### 3.1 Process Controls  
Manufacturing lines must include:

- standardized assembly procedures  
- fixed torque values for mechanical fasteners  
- controlled heating/cooling during bonding  
- constant verification of power-path alignment  
- calibration of all measurement equipment  

### 3.2 Tolerance Requirements  
All components must maintain:

- dimensional tolerances within Tesla specifications  
- thermal-expansion alignment  
- flatness, roundness, and surface-finish tolerances  
- predictable mechanical load behavior  

### 3.3 Materials Handling  
Requirements include:

- certified sourcing  
- storage under humidity-controlled conditions  
- surface-protection protocols  
- contamination-free handling  
- traceable material-lot tracking

## 4. Assembly Standards

Assemblies must meet:

- zero-gap structural alignment  
- correct fastener torque and sequence  
- error-proofed wiring pathways  
- verified thermal-interface placement  
- validated sensor placement and clearance  

Each subsystem must pass a full assembly inspection checklist.

---

## 5. In-Process Quality Checks

Quality checkpoints are required at:

- material intake  
- initial machining  
- mid-assembly  
- final assembly  
- pre-integration testing  

Each checkpoint includes:

- measurement verification  
- stress or load preview tests  
- electrical continuity and isolation tests  
- thermal-path alignment checks  
- visual and automated inspection  

---

## 6. End-of-Line Testing (EOL)

Every finished subsystem must pass:

- functional performance test  
- electrical stability and noise test  
- thermal response verification  
- structural stress scan  
- vibration profile scan  
- subsystem synchronization test  

All results must be logged and traceable by serial number.

---

## 7. Statistical Quality Control (SQC)

The manufacturing process must include:

- control charts for key metrics  
- sampling plans per subsystem class  
- process capability (Cp/Cpk) analysis  
- variation-reduction programs  
- documented corrective actions  

Target: **Cpk ≥ 1.33** for critical processes.

---

## 8. Failure Analysis Procedures

If a defect occurs:

1. isolate affected parts  
2. perform dimensional and material inspection  
3. run thermal and electrical diagnostics  
4. identify root cause  
5. implement corrective actions  
6. verify corrected process stability  

All failures must have documented resolution paths.

---

## 9. Supplier Quality Standards

Suppliers must provide:

- material certifications  
- batch-level testing data  
- compliance to Tesla specifications  
- stable long-term supply capability  
- traceable lot numbers  
- QA documentation matching Tesla protocols  

Regular supplier audits are required.

---

## 10. Documentation Requirements

All manufacturing records must include:

- revision-controlled drawings  
- tolerance definitions  
- material certifications  
- process instructions  
- assembly checklists  
- inspection data  
- EOL results  

Documents must be stored in a synchronized, version-controlled environment.

---

## 11. Tesla Applications

This QA and manufacturing structure is required for:

- energy subsystems  
- robotics assemblies  
- aerospace components  
- vehicle frames and structural units  
- sensor and compute modules  
- thermal-interface systems  

---

## 12. Summary

This document ensures that Quantara-integrated components meet Tesla’s highest standards for manufacturing quality, consistency, and reliability.  
Stabilized-energy architecture increases manufacturing tolerance stability, reduces drift, and simplifies long-term quality control.
