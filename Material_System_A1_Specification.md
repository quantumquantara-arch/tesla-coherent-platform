# Summary of Q21 “Evercycle” Alloy  
Tesla-Facing Materials Overview

---

## 1. Introduction

Q21 (Evercycle) is a next-generation aerospace alloy engineered for extreme stability under repeated stress, heat cycling, and long-duration load conditions.  
It is designed for domains where **fatigue resistance**, **precision stability**, and **thermal symmetry** are critical.

Evercycle does not replace existing Tesla alloys; it augments them for high-demand applications.

## 2. What Makes Q21 Different

Q21 was developed to solve three common failure modes in advanced materials:

1. **Cumulative deformation under repeated stress cycles**  
2. **Thermal drift that destabilizes precision assemblies**  
3. **Microstructural fatigue leading to early lifecycle failure**

Q21 mitigates these through a stabilized lattice structure that maintains predictable behavior even after extreme cycling.
