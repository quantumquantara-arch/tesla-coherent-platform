# Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategy  
Tesla × Quantara — Engineering Document

---

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the risk-assessment framework and mitigation strategies for integrating Quantara’s stabilized-energy architecture into Tesla systems.  
It defines the major risk categories, likelihood and severity evaluations, mitigation pathways, and residual-risk controls required for operational readiness.

---

## 2. Risk Categories

Risks are grouped into six domains:

1. **Technical Risks**  
2. **Operational Risks**  
3. **Manufacturing Risks**  
4. **Regulatory Risks**  
5. **Supply Chain Risks**  
6. **Safety Risks**  

Each domain includes specific failure modes and mitigation actions.

---

## 9. Risk Evaluation Matrix

Each risk is evaluated using:

- **Likelihood** (Low / Medium / High)  
- **Severity** (Low / Medium / High)  
- **Risk Level** (L, M, H)  

Mitigation must reduce residual risk to **Low**.

---

## 10. Monitoring & Review

Ongoing monitoring includes:

- real-time subsystem logs  
- thermal/electrical drift charts  
- vibration signatures  
- structural strain sensors  
- software activity logs  
- periodic audit review  

---

## 11. Residual Risk Acceptance

Residual risk may only be accepted when:

- mitigation is complete  
- system stability proven  
- safety margins met  
- Tesla engineering signs off  

---

## 12. Tesla Applications

Risk mitigation applies to:

- EV platforms  
- robotics and humanoids  
- aerospace systems  
- compute modules  
- structural assemblies  
- energy subsystems  

---

## 13. Summary

This strategy ensures that all risks associated with integrating Quantara architecture into Tesla systems are identified, managed, mitigated, and documented.  
Stabilized-energy pathways naturally reduce many high-impact risks, improving reliability and operational safety.
