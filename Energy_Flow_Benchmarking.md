## 8. Benchmark F — Long-Duration Reliability

**Purpose:**  
Evaluate lifetime advantages.

**Procedure:**  
1. Run multi-hour or multi-day continuous operation  
2. Record drift, degradation, and thermal changes  
3. Compare failure thresholds  

**Metrics:**  
- time-to-variance  
- heat accumulation  
- consistency of performance  
- degradation curve

## 10. Interpretation Guidelines

Improvements become meaningful when tests show:

- smoother energy curves  
- lower fluctuation amplitude  
- more consistent thermal patterns  
- reduced drift  
- shorter stabilization time  
- improved efficiency  
- greater fault resilience  

Even a small percentage improvement can produce large lifetime and safety benefits.
